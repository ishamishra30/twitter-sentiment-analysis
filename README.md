# Twitter-sentiment-analysis
Sentiment analysis refers to identifying as well as classifying the sentiments that are expressed in the text source. Tweets are often useful in generating a vast amount of sentiment data upon analysis. These data are useful in understanding the opinion of the people about a variety of topics.

Therefore we need to develop an Automated Machine Learning Sentiment Analysis Model in order to compute the customer perception. Due to the presence of non-useful characters (collectively termed as the noise) along with useful data, it becomes difficult to implement models on them.
# Project Pipeline
The various steps involved in the Machine Learning Pipeline are :

Import Necessary Dependencies

Read and Load the Dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis

Data Visualization of Target Variables

Data Preprocessing

Splitting our data into Train and Test Subset

Transforming Dataset using TF-IDF Vectorizer

Function for Model Evaluation

Model Building
